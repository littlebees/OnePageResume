# React OnePageResume

This resume template is from [HERE](https://css-tricks.com/one-page-resume-site).

I adjust something to make this template reponsive.

1. replaced float with css grid
2. used media-query for big screen width
3. used rem as the unit for most of the occurrences, except for the dotted underline of links
4. removed photo, because I don't like to put photos on resume
5. use ReactJs to render html from Json (but need many many improvement LoL)

## How to use

* Edit `src/db.json`
* `npm start`
